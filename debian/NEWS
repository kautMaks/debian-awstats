awstats (6.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  For security purposes, the confdir parameter is disabled by
  default. To enable it, set the AWSTATS_ENABLE_CONFIG_DIR
  environmental variable in the web environment. Allowing confdir to
  be set opens the door for a code injection attack, as explained in
  bug #365910. Note that upstream will fix this in the 6.6 release,
  but has not yet decided how they will address the issue (though they
  suggested the current patch).

awstats (6.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  Cache files are now located at /var/lib/awstats by default. Old
  files are automatically moved from /var/cache/awstats.  Exception:
  If the directory /var/lib/awstats exists already then no attempts on
  upgrading are done.

awstats (6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  If you use the ExtraSections feature, you must check that the
  parameter(s) ExtraSectionConditionX use a full REGEX syntax (with
  5.x series, this parameter could contain simple string values). If
  not, feature will be broken.

  If you use the Misc feature, you must check that your ShowMiscStats
  parameter is set to "ajdfrqwp", if you want to have all miscellanous
  info reported (you must also have added the awstats_misc_tracker.js
  script in your home page as described in MiscTrackerUrl parameter
  description). Otherwise the new default value "a" will be used (only
  the "Add to favourites" will be reported).

  MaxLengthOfURL parameter has been renamed into MaxLengthOfShownURL.

  To enable the new worm detection, you must add parameter
  LevelForWormsDetection=2 in your config file.

  If you used the urlalias or userinfo plugin, you must move the
  urlalias.*.txt or userinfo.*.txt file from Plugins directory to
  DirData directory.

awstats (5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  AWStats 5.0 is compatible with previous versions (3.x or 4.x).
  However if you use awstats 5.0 runtime to read statistics for old
  month build with 3.x or 4.x, speed will be a little bit reduce but
  data will be reported correctly.

  To benefit the speed/memory improvement of 5.0 (2 to 8 times faster
  when reading stats, less memory use) you can migrate your history
  files with the command:
    
    awstats.pl -migrate="/fullpath/awstatsMMYYYY.configval.txt"
